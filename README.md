# AzDM - Azure DevOps Manager

This is the home of the Azure DevOps manager, or the Dungeon Master if you will.

For code, modules, and templates, pleas visit the [AzDM template repo](https://github.com/AZDOPS/AzDMTemplate)

## What is AzDM?

AzDM is an [opinionated](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/802050/what-is-opinionated-software) project to manage Azure DevOps as code. It is _highly_ inspired by the [AzOps](https://github.com/Azure/AzOps) project, and stems from the idea that **_everything in Azure DevOps is a resource, and can be viewed and managed as a folder or file configuration_**

This is not to be considered a "one click solution", but a base for you to build on. You may need to implement extra settings, or add your own configurations.

The core functionality comes from the [AzDM module](./documentation/module.md) written in PowerShell, and the related [pipelines](https://github.com/AZDOPS/AzDMTemplate/tree/main/.pipelines)

## Getting started

For tutorials, please see [the setup documentation](./documentation/Setup/requirements.md), the [functionality documentation](./documentation/readme.md), or check out [the setup accelerator scripts](./setupAccelerator/readme.md)

Documentation and examples are currently being worked on and will be updated as soon as possible.

## Folder structure

The managed Azure DevOps organization is set up with folders representing Azure DevOps projects and tries to emulate the GUI layout of Azure DevOps - `Overview`, `boards`, `repos`, `pipelines`, `test Plans`, `Artifacts` - Although most of the functionality is still a work in progress.
