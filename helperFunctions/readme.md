# Helper functions

This folder contains some PowerShell helper functions to make your AzDM journey easier.

Help for each function _should_ be included in the function .ps1 file.

These files are dependent on reading the actual repo and parsing data, and some (most) functions _will not_ work offline. The main reason for this is design - We parse the online help to not have to update multiple places. This also means that any updates to help docs _must_ follow the current design pattern.
